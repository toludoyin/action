Steps:

1. Collection and exploration of data

2. Modelling

3. Model to pickle

4. Flask app:

a. procfile

indicate to heroku which file to start execution from

b. create requirement.txt

create virtual enviroment (carpredictor) using python3 -m venv(env-name)

activate virtual enviroment using source (env-name)/bin/activate

install libraries and dependencies into requirement.txt using pip freeze > reqirement.txt

when clone from git to local machine use pip install -r requirements.txt to install packages

 c. index.html

 d. app.py

 5. Heroku: for amazon web service
